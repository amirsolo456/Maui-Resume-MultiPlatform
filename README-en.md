# üöÄ Resume.Maui - Full-Stack Project Overview

---

## üá¨üáß English Version

### üìù Project Overview  

**Resume.Maui** is a **full-stack**, multi-platform application built using the latest Microsoft technologies. This project demonstrates a deep integration of **front-end UI**, **business logic**, and **database management** ‚Äî all crafted with maintainability, scalability, and modern best practices in mind.

The goal was to deliver a clean, maintainable, and professional-grade app that runs seamlessly on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows ‚Äî all sharing the majority of their codebase through a shared MAUI XAML project.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è _Note:_  
> While a **MAUI Hybrid** approach (combining Blazor and MAUI) could simplify development by unifying web and native UI, this project deliberately uses pure **MAUI XAML** to demonstrate expertise in both **native MAUI UI development** and **cross-platform UI design**.  
>  
> Similarly, although **SQLite** is typically the preferred embedded database for projects of this size due to its simplicity and lightweight footprint, here **SQL Server** was used intentionally to showcase integration with a full-fledged RDBMS and more complex data scenarios.

### üí° Technologies Used & Why

| Layer           | Technology                 | Purpose & Explanation |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| **UI (Front-End)**    | **.NET MAUI (XAML)**          | Native cross-platform UI framework that allows writing a single UI codebase for Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows. XAML provides a powerful, declarative syntax to design clean, maintainable UI layouts with support for animations, styles, data binding, and MVVM patterns. |
| **MVVM Architecture** | **Model-View-ViewModel**       | A design pattern that separates UI logic (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model), enhancing testability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. This makes the app robust and easier to extend. |
| **Dependency Injection** | **Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection** | Ensures modular, loosely-coupled components by injecting dependencies through constructors or properties, which also improves testability and scalability. |
| **Data Access Layer** | **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** | Object-relational mapper (ORM) used to interact with the SQL Server database using C# objects, abstracting raw SQL queries and enabling migrations, seeding, and LINQ queries for cleaner data access. |
| **Database**          | **Microsoft SQL Server**       | A full-featured, enterprise-grade relational database system. Chosen here to showcase integration with complex, scalable databases, and support advanced querying and transactional integrity beyond lightweight embedded databases like SQLite. |
| **Build & Deployment**| **.NET 9.0 + MAUI Tooling**    | The latest .NET SDK to ensure access to the newest language features, improved performance, and MAUI‚Äôs cross-platform deployment capabilities. Single-project structure simplifies multi-target builds for Android, iOS, Mac Catalyst, and Windows. |
| **Logging & Diagnostics** | **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging** | Provides robust logging support to help track app behavior during development and production, making debugging and monitoring easier and more professional. |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Why Not Other Options?

- **Why not MAUI Hybrid (Blazor)?**  
  While MAUI Hybrid (Blazor + MAUI) allows building web and native UI together, this project purposely focuses on **pure MAUI XAML** to highlight proficiency in native UI design, providing smoother performance and deeper platform integration.

- **Why SQL Server, not SQLite?**  
  Although SQLite is ideal for small-scale local storage due to its simplicity, SQL Server was selected to demonstrate real-world database integration skills, including complex querying, migrations, and enterprise-grade data management.

### ‚≠ê Key Features & Full-Stack Architecture

- üéØ **Multi-platform Support**  
  Runs natively on **Android**, **iOS**, **macOS**, and **Windows** ‚Äî all sharing a single **MAUI XAML** codebase that ensures smooth, native user experiences.

- üñºÔ∏è **XAML-based UI (Frontend)**  
  UI is crafted with declarative XAML, leveraging the **MVVM** pattern for clean separation of concerns. This enables powerful data binding, styles, animations, and maintainable UI layouts.

- üåê **Web API Backend**  
  The project includes an **ASP.NET Core Web API** backend that manages client-server communication, business logic, validation, and database interactions.

- üîÑ **RESTful API Architecture**  
  Uses REST principles for standard, secure, and scalable communication between frontend and backend, primarily exchanging JSON payloads.

- üß© **MVVM Architecture (Frontend)**  
  Clear division between View (UI), ViewModel (presentation logic), and Model (data), improving testability, maintainability, and code clarity.

- üóÑÔ∏è **Data Access Layer**  
  Utilizes **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** as the ORM to model and interact with the **SQL Server** database, supporting migrations, LINQ queries, and data seeding.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Backend Technologies**  
  - **ASP.NET Core 9.0 Web API:** Robust platform for building RESTful services  
  - **Dependency Injection:** Manages service lifetimes and dependencies cleanly across backend layers  
  - **Logging & Monitoring:** Employs Microsoft.Extensions.Logging for production-grade diagnostics

- üîå **Dependency Injection**  
  Dependency Injection is employed throughout the entire stack, enabling modular, testable, and maintainable components.

- üíæ **Database**  
  Uses **Microsoft SQL Server** to showcase real-world enterprise database integration, enabling advanced querying and transactional consistency. While **SQLite** would be simpler for smaller projects, SQL Server demonstrates handling complex data scenarios.

- üåç **Localization Ready**  
  Designed with localization in mind, supporting multiple languages via resource files and XAML bindings.

- üöÄ **Modern .NET 9 + MAUI Tooling**  
  Leverages the latest .NET SDK and MAUI tools for optimal performance, streamlined multi-platform builds, and deployment.
